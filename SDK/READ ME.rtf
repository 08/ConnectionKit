Welcome to the Sandvox Plug-in SDK!\
\
This package provides examples based on two of Sandvox\'92s built-in plug-ins. Full documentation can be found on our website at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://docs.karelia.com/z/Sandvox_Developers_Guide.html"}}{\fldrslt http://docs.karelia.com/z/Sandvox_Developers_Guide.html}}. 
\b Some familiarity with Cocoa programming is required.

\
Between the documentation/reference and these examples, you should be able to see how to build a plug-in of your own. Let us know if you have created a new plug-in that you can share so we can help tell the world about it!}
