Notes on Using the Connection Framework

Dependencies:

DotMacSDK v2 DP2 is currently tested

Use of the WebDAVConnection requires the use of the Apple Private Framework to be linked in, DAVKit.framework.
When not linking in this framework you will need to include the InterThreadMessaging class yourself. There is 
however a multiple symbols warning when linking DotMacSDK and DAVKit, but testing has showed this to be okay if 
you add the -bind_at_load to the linker flags in the target.
