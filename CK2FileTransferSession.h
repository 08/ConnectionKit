//  Created by Mike on 08/10/2012.

//  Usage:
//  Much like NSFileManager, alloc + init your own instance. Likely you'll want to give it a delegate so can handle authentication challenges. Then just use the instance methods to perform your desired file operations.

#pragma mark Discovering Directory Contents

// NSFileManager is poorly documented in this regard, but according to 10.6's release notes, an empty array for keys means to include nothing, whereas nil means to include "a standard set" of values. We try to do much the same by handling nil to fill in all reasonable values the connection hands us as part of doing a directory listing. If you want more specifics, supply your own keys array
// In order to supply resource values, have to work around rdar://problem/11069131 by returning a custom NSURL subclass. Can't guarantee therefore that they will work correctly with the CFURL APIs. So far in practice the only incompatibility I've found is CFURLHasDirectoryPath() always returning NO

               completionHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *contents, NSError *error))block;

// More advanced version of directory listing
//  * listing results are delivered as they arrive over the wire, if possible
//  * FIRST result is the directory itself, with relative path resolved if possible
//  * MIGHT do true recursion of the directory tree in future, so include NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsSubdirectoryDescendants for stable results
//
// All docs for -contentsOfDirectoryAtURL:â€¦ should apply here too

#pragma mark Getting and Setting Attributes
// Only NSFilePosixPermissions is recognised at present. Note that some servers don't support this so will return an error (code 500)
// All other attributes are ignored

#pragma mark Delegate
// Delegate messages are delivered on the same queue that was used to instantiate the session. So changing delegate might mean you still receive message shortly after the change. Not ideal I know!

#pragma mark URLs
// These two methods take into account the specifics of different URL schemes. e.g. for the same relative path, but different base schemes:
//  http://example.com/relative/path
//  ftp://example.com/relative/path
//  ssh://example.com/~/relative/path
//
// Takes care of the file URL bug on 10.6

/*!
 @method         canHandleURL:
 
 @abstract
 Performs a "preflight" operation that performs some speculative checks to see if a URL has a suitable protocol registered to handle it.
 
 @discussion
 The result of this method is valid only as long as no protocols are registered or unregistered, and as long as the request is not mutated (if the request is mutable). Hence, clients should be prepared to handle failures even if they have performed request preflighting by calling this method.
 
 @param
 url     The URL to preflight.
 
 @result
 YES         if it is likely that the given request can be used to
 perform a file operation and the associated I/O can be
 started
