TJT rebuilt binary for MAS (i386) on 19 Sept 2011

png2ico requires libpng to build. libpng is included in /usr/X11 in 10.6/10.7 so Makefile was adjusted to use that location for headers and linking.


DJW's original notes on building fat:

First build it with this as the CPP flags:

-arch i386
move to png2ico.i386

then -arch ppc
move to png2ico.ppc

lipo -create png2ico.i386 png2ico.ppc -output png2ico

png2ico favicon.ico --colors 16 32.png 16.png
