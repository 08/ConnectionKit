        <p>A contact form can be either a <a href="Page.html" title="Page">page</a> or <a href="Pagelet.html" title="Pagelet">pagelet</a>. It lets site visitors contact you easily and securely by filling in a few details. Best of all, it lets your visitors contact you without requiring you to display your email address.</p>

        <p><br />
        After clicking the "Send" button, visitors are redirected to a special page on Karelia's website that informs them whether their message has been successfully sent. This page should match the <a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a> of your site as closely as possible, however there may be some small differences for things like <a href="Graphical_Text.html" title="Graphical Text">graphical text</a> or if you have customized the <a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a>. Visitors are then able to return to your site.</p>

        <p>In some rare cases, Karelia may not be able to determine the site from which a visitor came originally. In that case, no link back to your site is provided. Visitors will have to use the back button to return.</p>

            <p><b>Ways to add a Contact Form to a site:</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use the "Pages" or "Pagelets" items in the <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a>.</li>

                <li>Choose "Add Page" or "Add Pagelet" from the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><a name="Security" id="Security"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Security</span></h2><a name="Encryption" id="Encryption"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Encryption</span></h3>

        <p>In order to protect your e-mail address from spammers, the Contact Forms in Sandvox encrypt it. When a visitor clicks the "Send" button, their message is actually sent to Karelia's servers. The server then decrypts your address and relays the message to you. (Karelia does not log or monitor the contents of the messages being sent; however, we may monitor other information such as referring pages, to check for abuse of the service. If you are concerned about your messages being passed through a Karelia server, you are welcome to <a href="Hidden_Preferences.html#Contact_Form" title="Hidden Preferences">install the form processor script on your own server</a>.)</p>

        <p>It is not a good idea for your web site's visitors to send you highly confidential messages using a Contact Form. Messages are sent "in the clear" from your website to Karelia's servers, and are then sent out as unencrypted e-mails.</p>

        <p>Please note that Karelia cannot guarantee that your email address is 100% protected from exposure. If somebody sends a message and for some reason their message is not deliverable, it will 'bounce' back to them; that bounce message will contain the full message headers including your receiving email address.</p><a name="Identifying_the_Sender.27s_IP_Address" id="Identifying_the_Sender.27s_IP_Address"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Identifying the Sender's IP Address</span></h3>

        <p>When you receive messages sent through your contact form, you can determine the IP address of the person who filled out the form by looking at the hidden message header "X-Remote-Addr." You would see this in Apple Mail, for example, by choosing View &gt; Message &gt; Long Headers. If you need to set up your mail filters to handle particular senders in special ways, the sender's IP address can be a useful piece of information.</p><a name="Settings" id="Settings"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">E-mail Address</span></h3>

        <p>Enter your e-mail address into the "Send to" box. You can have e-mails sent to multiple addresses at the same time by entering them separated by commas like so:</p>
        <pre>
me@example.com, someoneelse@example.com
</pre>

        <p>To keep your address secure, Sandvox encrypts it. To find out how and why, please see the <a href="Contact_Form.html#Security" title="Contact Form">security</a> section of this article.</p><a name="Customizing_Fields" id="Customizing_Fields"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Customizing Fields</span></h3>

        <p>When you create a Contact Form, Sandvox supplies a typical set of fields and a Send button. You can customize any of the fields and the Send button, and you can add more fields.</p>

        <p>Click on the "Fields" tab to see menus that will let you customize each field.</p>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="floatnone">

        </div>

        <p>The five default fields are already listed for you. You can change the order of the fields by dragging them within the list.</p>

        <p>The lock icon to the right of each default field indicates that these fields can not be deleted (although they can be hidden).</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>

            <dd>The "Name" field can be hidden using the pull-down menu under "Type." The label on the "Name" field can be changed by typing a different label in the box marked "Label."</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>Email</dt>

            <dd>To change the label on the "Email" field, click "Email" on the left and then type a new label in the "Label" box.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>Message Subject</dt>

            <dd>
                The default text field allows visitors to enter any subject they want. If you would like to give visitors a set list of subjects to choose from, select "Subject" on the left and then "Type" to Radio Buttons or Popup. Then list the choices you want visitors to see in the box marked "Choices." Separate the subjects with commas like this:
                <pre>
cheddar, stilton, edam
</pre>You can also change the label for the field. If you choose to hide the subject field, you can enter text that will appear as the subject line for any message a visitor sends.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>Message</dt>

            <dd>Select "Message" on the left and then use the pull-down menu to hide the "Message" field or change it into a Send button. Type new text in the box marked "Label" to change the label of the "Message" field.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>Send</dt>

            <dd>Select "Send" on the left and then type new text in the box marked "Label" if you'd like to change the words on the Send button.</dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>Add a Field</dt>

            <dd>Click the + button in the lower left to add a new field. This can be useful if you'd like to ask visitors for different kinds of information.</dd>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Testing</span></h2>

        <p>Before <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> your site, it is a good idea to test the Contact Form to ensure it is correctly set up.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To test the Contact Form:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>From the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a> select "Export Site…" Export the site to a suitable location such as a folder on your Desktop, entering the URL of your site if needed.</li>

                <li>Open the folder you exported to and then open the "Index_.html" file in it with your web browser.</li>

                <li>Navigate to the Contact Form.</li>

                <li>Enter a test message and send it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
