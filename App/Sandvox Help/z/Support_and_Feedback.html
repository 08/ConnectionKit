        <p>You may need to contact Karelia for support with Sandvox, or to give us some feedback (e.g. to report a bug or request a feature). Our preferred method is to use Sandvox's built-in Feedback Reporter:</p>

            <dt>Include filtered console log</dt>

            <dd>If you are having an issue with Sandvox, including the console log can help us track down the problem.</dd>

            <dt>Include screenshot</dt>

            <dd>Includes a screenshot of the frontmost <a href="Document_Window.html" title="Document Window">document window</a> and the <a href="The_Inspector.html" title="Inspector">Inspector</a> with the report. Useful if reporting an issue with something visual.</dd>

            <dt>Summary</dt>

            <dd>A quick summary of the report.</dd>

            <dt>URL</dt>

            <dd>If reporting an issue with a <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">published</a> site, enter the site's address to help us identify the problem.</dd>

            <dt>Details</dt>

            <dd>A detailed description of the bug or feature.</dd>

        </dl>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To contact Karelia for support or feedback:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose "Send Feedback…" from the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Help" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Help menu</a>.</li>

                <li>Fill in the fields of the feedback form as described above.</li>

                <li>Click the "Send Feedback" button.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It is also possible to use our <a href="http://www.karelia.com/contact/" class="external text" title="http://www.karelia.com/contact/">contact page</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you are working without an Internet connection, or if our servers are unreachable to submit your feedback, you will be given the option to save your report (as an RTFD file) and email it to us later.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can use our <a href="http://www.karelia.com/contact/" class="external text" title="http://www.karelia.com/contact/">online support</a> to contact Karelia.</p><a name="Case_Numbers" id="Case_Numbers"></a>

        <h2>Case Numbers</h2>

        <p>When you first submit a feedback report it is assigned a unique case number. This number allows us to better track reports during any correspondence. When following up a bug or a feature request with us, please include the case number.</p>

        <p>Once you have sent a report you receive an automatic response e-mail from Karelia confirming receipt of the feedback. Your case number can be found in the message subject.</p><a name="Attachments" id="Attachments"></a>

        <h2>Attachments</h2>

        <p>Sometimes as part of your feedback or support request, you may need to send Karelia a Sandvox <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> file to demonstrate the case.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>If the document is 1 MB in size or less:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open a support request using the Feedback Reporter as detailed above (you may already have done this). Be sure to include your address in the "From" field.</li>

                <li>
                    <p>You should have received an e-mail from Karelia in response to your request. This will either be simply acknowledging the request, or from us asking for more information.</p>

                    <p>The important thing is that this e-mail contains your case number in the message subject. Reply to it.</p>
                </li>

                <li>As part of your reply, attach the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> to the e-mail.</li>

                <li>Send the message.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>If the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> is larger than 1 MB, e-mail is not a suitable method for transferring it to us. Karelia provide a special <a href="FTP_client.html" title="FTP">FTP</a> site to which you can upload <a href="Document.html" title="Document">documents</a>.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To upload a Sandvox document to our FTP site:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Launch your FTP client software. If you do not have any such software already installed, we recommend the free, open-source <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" class="external text" title="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a>. Similar instructions apply to other clients.</li>

                <li>
                    <p>In Cyberduck choose "File → Open Connection…" and enter the following settings:</p>

                    <div class="bordimg">
                        <img src="img/5/5c/Upload.karelia_FTP_settings.jp2" alt="upload.karelia FTP settings" width="385" height="351" />
                    </div>

                    <p>If you are using a different FTP client open a connection with the same settings as above using the appropriate method for your software.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Locate the site <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> in the Finder.</li>

                <li>Make a copy of the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> and then rename it. It is <b>very important</b> that the new name you give the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> contains your support <a href="Support_and_Feedback.html#Case_Numbers" title="Support and Feedback">case number</a>.</li>

                <li>Drag the new <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> and drop it on the "uploads" folder in Cyberduck or your FTP client. Be patient, the transfer may take a while.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>The uploads folder is configured as a drop box. You can add files to it, but not see what files are already in the directory. This is for privacy reasons to stop other people from seeing your site.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can use an FTP client (such as Cyberduck) to upload the site <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> to your own webspace. Then, use the Feedback Reporter (as described above) to contact Karelia and inform us of the location to download the file.</p><a name="Screenshots" id="Screenshots"></a>

        <h2>Screenshots</h2>

        <p>We may request that you send us a screenshot to aid in identifying the cause of an issue. For directions on taking a screenshot, please follow the instructions in this <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/cdb_scrshtfky.html" class="external text" title="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/cdb_scrshtfky.html">Apple support article</a>. Once you have taken the screenshot, attach it to your e-mail as detailed above.</p><a name="Sandvox_Crashes" id="Sandvox_Crashes"></a>

        <h2>Sandvox Crashes</h2>

        <p>Sandvox also features a crash reporter which will automatically report any crashes when you next relaunch the application. For more information, please see "<a href="What_to_do_if_Sandvox_crashes.html" title="What to do if Sandvox crashes">What to do if Sandvox crashes</a>."</p>
