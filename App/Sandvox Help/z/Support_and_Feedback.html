        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Getting Support</span></h2>

        <p>The <a href="Support_Forum.html" title="Support Forum">Sandvox Support Forum</a> is a web-based forum, where users are encouraged to submit problems, questions, and suggestions. In this web-based community, Sandvox users help other Sandvox users in a timely manner. Karelia staff monitor this group to file feature requests appropriately, provide help, and track problems. To visit the Sandvox Support Forum when you're working in the program, go to the Sandvox menu and select "Visit Support Forum."</p><a name="Providing_Feedback_Directly_to_Karelia" id="Providing_Feedback_Directly_to_Karelia"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Providing Feedback Directly to Karelia</span></h2>

        <p>If you need to contact Karelia directly for support, our preferred method is to use Sandvox's built-in Feedback Reporter:</p>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="floatnone">
                <span><img alt="" src="img/b/ba/Feedback_window.jp2" width="468" height="329" /></span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <dl>
            <dt>From</dt>

            <dd>The email address at which Karelia may contact you regarding the report. This field is optional. (You may empty this field to submit an anonymous comment, but we cannot reply if you do.)</dd>

            <dt>Send myself a copy</dt>

            <dd>If checked, you will be sent a copy of the report exactly as it was submitted to Karelia.</dd>

            <dt>Subject</dt>

            <dd>A quick summary of the report.</dd>

            <dt>Details</dt>

            <dd>A detailed description of the bug or feature. Please note the information we request when reporting a bug: what you were doing, what happened, and what should have happened?</dd>

            <dt>Followup Case #</dt>

            <dd>If you are following up on an existing case you have already opened with our support team, please check this box and enter the case number. Doing so will automatically associate your message with our previous correspondence.</dd>

            <dt>Attach</dt>

            <dd>
                You can attach specific kinds of files to your message by checking the options below. (You can't attach files other than the kinds listed below to this message; if it's necessary to send some other kind of file, you would have to do that in a followup message.)

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Filtered console log</b> includes any error and warning messages generated by the application; this is quite useful to attach when you are having problems.</li>

                    <li>When <b>screenshot</b> is checked, Sandvox automatically takes a screenshot of whatever is visible in the Sandvox windows at the moment and attaches that screenshot to your message. This is most useful when your message describes a visual problem or something else that is showing on the windows when you are filling out this form. If you wish to send a screenshot you took yourself and that is not currently visible in the Sandvox windows, you will have to attach that in a followup message.</li>

                    <li><b>Preferences</b> includes the current settings for the application.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To contact Karelia for support or feedback:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose "Send Feedbackâ€¦" from the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Help" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Sandvox menu</a>.</li>

                <li>Fill in the fields of the feedback form as described above.</li>

                <li>Click the "Send Feedback" button.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It is also possible to use our <a href="http://www.karelia.com/contact/" class="external text" title="http://www.karelia.com/contact/">contact page</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you are working without an Internet connection, or if our servers are unreachable to submit your feedback, you will be given the option to save your report (as an RTFD file) and email it to us later.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can use our <a href="http://www.karelia.com/how_do_i/" class="external text" title="http://www.karelia.com/how_do_i/">online support</a> to contact Karelia.</p>

        <p>If you are working without an Internet connection, or you encounter other difficulties sending your feedback, your message will be saved and automatically sent the next time Sandvox is launched and there is an Internet connection available.</p><a name="Case_Numbers" id="Case_Numbers"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Case Numbers</span></h3>

        <p>When you first submit a feedback report it is assigned a unique case number. This number allows us to better track reports during any correspondence. When following up a bug or a feature request with us, please include the case number.</p>

        <p>Once you have sent a report you receive an automatic response email from Karelia confirming receipt of the feedback. Your case number can be found in the message subject.</p>

        <p>Note that if you do not provide your email address, we cannot send you a case number or confirmation.</p><a name="Attachments" id="Attachments"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Attachments</span></h3>

        <p>Sometimes as part of your feedback or support request, you may need to send Karelia a Sandvox <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> file to demonstrate the case.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>If the document is 3 MB in size or less:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Compress your document into a "zip" file (from the File menu, choose "Compress").</li>

                <li>Open a support request using the Feedback Reporter as detailed above (you may already have done this). Be sure to include your address in the "From" field.</li>

                <li>
                    <p>You should have received an e-mail from Karelia in response to your request. This will either be simply acknowledging the request, or from us asking for more information.</p>

                    <p>The important thing is that this e-mail contains your case number in the message subject. Reply to it.</p>
                </li>

                <li>As part of your reply, attach the <a href="Document.html" title="Document">document</a> to the e-mail.</li>

                <li>Send the message.</li>

        <div class="instructions">

            <ol>
                <li>Rename your document (or folder containing the document) to include the case number, so we can keep track of the file.</li>

                <li>Download our <a href="http://www.karelia.com/files/Upload_to_Karelia.zip" class="external text" title="http://www.karelia.com/files/Upload_to_Karelia.zip">Upload to Karelia</a> utility.</li>
