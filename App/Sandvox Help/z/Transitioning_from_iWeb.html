        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What are the major differences in approach between Sandvox and iWeb?</span></h4>

        <p>iWeb is very much a scaled-down, free form page editing tool. Sites are built one page at a time, with each element of each new page frequently needing to be hand-tuned to look just right. Great for small sites with only a few pages to maintain, particularly if each page is one of the pre-canned page types where design elements are intended to be radically different from page to page.</p>

        <p>Sandvox, by contrast, tends to take a “set it and forget it” approach to site design and maintenance, working with the site as a conceptual whole. Many elements can be automatically inherited from page to page as new pages are added. E.g., the <a href="Site_Title.html" title="Site Title">site title</a> and <a href="Banner.html" title="Banner">banner</a> (if present) are automatically carried over to each page of the site for consistency in feel and presentation. <a href="Sidebar.html" title="Sidebar">Sidebar</a> objects present in parent <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collections</a> are automatically displayed in their child pages, though this, too, is adjustable. This lets Sandvox scale a site to hundreds of pages (or more), asking you to add just the content that differs from page to page. This automatic structure also helps Sandvox implement standard SEO techniques without you having to worry about how your site will be perceived by search engines.</p><a name="Terminology_.26_User_Interface" id="Terminology_.26_User_Interface"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminology &amp; User Interface</span></h2><a name="What_are_the_major_terminology_differences_between_Sandvox_and_iWeb.3F_What_are_the_major_interface_differences_between_Sandvox_and_iWeb.3F" id="What_are_the_major_terminology_differences_between_Sandvox_and_iWeb.3F_What_are_the_major_interface_differences_between_Sandvox_and_iWeb.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What are the major terminology differences between Sandvox and iWeb? What are the major interface differences between Sandvox and iWeb?</span></h4>

        <p>While the major editing components of Sandvox and iWeb are very similar, there are some differences in terminology that are important to keep in mind. The major components of Sandvox are:</p>

        <p><a href="Site_Navigator.html" title="Site Outline">The Site Navigator</a>, sometimes also called the Site Outline, is the hierarchical list of pages in your site found on the far left of the Sandvox document window. iWeb typically calls this the Sidebar. We use the term <a href="Sidebar.html" title="Sidebar">sidebar</a> completely differently; in Sandvox, the sidebar refers to an actual area of the published site. It is the narrow column to the left or right, depending on design, of the main text and is often used to hold smaller, secondary content such as badges, Like buttons, Twitter streams, and so forth.</p>

        <p><a href="Web_View.html" title="Web View">The Web Editor</a>, known as the Canvas is iWeb, is where you compose your site. Backed by an editable version of Safari’s WebKit, the Web Editor is where you edit the content of your site as well as see it take shape exactly as it will appear in Safari and other browsers. Like iWeb, and unlike other products, there is no preview mode separate from the live editor. Unlike iWeb, however, Sandvox is showing you fully constructed HTML for each page. You can even look at the HTML for an entire page using the "View → Web View → HTML Source" menu item.</p>

        <p>Below the Web Editor is the <a href="Page_Details.html" title="Page Details">Page Details</a> Area that provides an expanded area for examining and changing the URL of a page, its <a href="Window_Title.html" title="Window Title">window title</a>, and its <a href="Meta_Description.html" title="Meta Description">meta description</a>.</p>

        <p>In addition to the Page Details Area, the <a href="Inspector.html" title="Inspector">Inspector</a> works very similarly to the iWeb inspector, presenting various properties about the site in general, the selected page, or a selected object on the page, depending on context.</p>

        <p>Like iWeb, Sandvox automatically constructs a menu across the top of the site to guide the visitor from page to page. iWeb calls this the Navigation Menu; Sandvox calls it the <a href="Site_Menu.html" title="Site Menu">Site Menu</a>. You use the <a href="Page_Inspector.html" title="Page Inspector">Page Inspector</a> to adjust whether a page in your site is included in the site menu and whether it should have a title different from its (possibly quite a bit longer) standard page title.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the overall look and feel of each page in iWeb is governed by its Theme. Sandvox uses the term <a href="Design.html" title="Design">Design</a> and the chosen design applies to every page on the site.</p>

        <p>iWeb includes a handful of Widgets, such as RSS Feeds and HTML Snippets. Sandvox calls these <a href="Object.html" title="Object">Objects</a> and they are available from the Objects <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a> item or the "Insert" menu in the main menu bar.</p>

        <p>Sandvox is also document-based, rather than all sites being shown within a single window. When you create a new Sandvox document, Sandvox asks you to pick a starting <a href="Design.html" title="Design">Design</a> (you can always change it later) and automatically creates the top-level index page for your site. iWeb typically calls this the Welcome page; Sandvox calls it the <a href="Home_Page.html" title="Home Page">Home Page</a>.</p>

        <p>One thing to note, <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> setup is done through the <a href="Host_Setup_Assistant.html" title="Host Setup Assistant">Host Setup Assistant</a>, rather than through the Inspector or a different view of the Web Editor as it is in iWeb.</p>

        <p>Lastly, Sandvox, as mentioned above, typically lends itself a more highly structured site, as typically seen in the hierarchical Site Navigator. Related to this are three important terms that are used throughout the Sandvox documentation: <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">Collections</a>, parents or parent pages, and children or child pages. Unlike iWeb which really only provides nesting of pages of movies and photos within a My Albums page, Sandvox has the ability to treat any page as the index of a collection that contains any other page type. When a single page becomes an index page, we say it has become a <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collection</a> and is the parent page of whatever child pages it contains. Much of the expressive power of Sandvox comes from working with collections and even collections of collections.</p>

        <p>These terms will become more and more familiar as you work with Sandvox.</p><a name="Making_the_Transition" id="Making_the_Transition"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Making the Transition</span></h2><a name="How_do_I_convert_my_iWeb_site_to_a_Sandvox_site.3F" id="How_do_I_convert_my_iWeb_site_to_a_Sandvox_site.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I convert my iWeb site to a Sandvox site?</span></h4>

        <p>Because of the proprietary themes and page layout structure used by iWeb, there is no way currently to import an iWeb site directly into a Sandvox document. In short, the bulk of a site will need to be rebuilt. Hopefully once the general look and feel is set up (<a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a> is chosen, <a href="Site_Title.html" title="Site Title">site title</a> entered, <a href="Banner.html" title="Banner">banner</a> adjusted, etc.), adding pages and bringing content over is not too much of a pain. You should be able to copy/paste graphics and text from your iWeb site directly into your Sandvox document, either from iWeb directly or, using your favorite web browser, from your published site.</p>

        <p>One thing to keep in mind is that because the design used in Sandvox will be necessarily different from the design in iWeb, copying text directly may bring with it unwanted formatting or font changes. When pasting, you can use "Edit → Paste and Match Style" to bring text in using the default style of the Sandvox design. You can also use "Format → Clear Style" after the fact to remove unwanted styling.</p><a name="Can_I_make_my_Sandvox_site_look_exactly_like_my_old_iWeb_site.3F" id="Can_I_make_my_Sandvox_site_look_exactly_like_my_old_iWeb_site.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Can I make my Sandvox site look exactly like my old iWeb site?</span></h4>

        <p>Because of the proprietary nature of Apple’s themes, this is unlikely. Sandvox is not able to reuse the graphics and underlying layout of iWeb’s themes. There are plenty of great <a href="Design.html" title="Design">designs</a> available for Sandvox. You might consider this transition as an opportunity to freshen up.</p><a name="Does_Sandvox_do_exactly_everything_iWeb_does.3F" id="Does_Sandvox_do_exactly_everything_iWeb_does.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Does Sandvox do exactly everything iWeb does?</span></h4>

        <p>No, and iWeb does not do everything that Sandvox can do. However, the main components are quite similar and there are generally workarounds for specific issues. iWeb has a few widgets that Sandvox does not yet have, such as Google AdSense. If your site depends on one of these widgets, you may need to use a <a href="Raw_HTML.html" title="Raw HTML">Raw HTML</a> object instead. Sandvox is under continuous development and new features are being added regularly.</p><a name="What_will_happen_to_my_old_iWeb_site.3F" id="What_will_happen_to_my_old_iWeb_site.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What will happen to my old iWeb site?</span></h4>

        <p>This depends on where your iWeb site is being hosted. If your iWeb site is hosted on MobileMe, Apple has announced that MobileMe will be discontinued as of June 30, 2012. If you do not move your site from MobileMe before June 30, 2012, it will essentially disappear from the Internet.</p><a name="Should_I_do_something_to_my_old_site_to_let_people_know_it.27s_moving.3F" id="Should_I_do_something_to_my_old_site_to_let_people_know_it.27s_moving.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Should I do something to my old site to let people know it's moving?</span></h4>

        <p>Yes! You should definitely place a very prominent message on the Welcome page of your site saying that your site has moved and giving out the new site’s URL. For example, consider placing something like:</p>
        <pre>
“This website has moved. Please update your bookmarks to point to : &lt;URL&gt;”
</pre>

        <p>at the top of your Welcome page and/or possibly all pages of your old site. It might also be possible to use a JavaScript snippet to cause what’s known as a redirect to automatically take visitors to your site's new location. The <a href="http://iwebfaq.org/site/iWeb_Redirect.html" class="external text" title="http://iwebfaq.org/site/iWeb_Redirect.html">iWeb FAQ</a> seems to have some information on this, though Karelia has not tested this and makes no guarantees. Keep in mind that even a redirect will stop working when MobileMe goes away.</p><a name="How_should_I_tell_people_where_the_new_site_is.3F" id="How_should_I_tell_people_where_the_new_site_is.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How should I tell people where the new site is?</span></h4>

        <p>Whatever way you can. And you want to do it as soon as possible so that visitors and search engines becomes aware of your new site location before the old site goes away.</p><a name="What_are_some_cool_things_that_Sandvox_can_do_that_I_wasn.E2.80.99t_getting_with_iWeb.3F" id="What_are_some_cool_things_that_Sandvox_can_do_that_I_wasn.E2.80.99t_getting_with_iWeb.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What are some cool things that Sandvox can do that I wasn’t getting with iWeb?</span></h4>

        <p>Chief among these are Sandvox’s <a href="Sandvox_sites_and_search_engines.html" title="Sandvox sites and search engines">SEO</a> features and <a href="Google_Integration.html" title="Google Integration">Google Analytics integration</a>. There are also plenty of other objects to play with, such as <a href="Twitter.html" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="Facebook_Button.html" title="Facebook Button">Facebook Buttons</a>, <a href="Flickr_Badge.html" title="Flickr Badge">Flickr</a> photos, and <a href="Contact_Form.html" title="Contact Form">Contact Forms</a>.</p><a name="How_do_you_manage_multiple_sites.3F" id="How_do_you_manage_multiple_sites.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do you manage multiple sites?</span></h4>

        <p>Each Sandvox site is its own document with its own settings. Documents are saved with the extension .sandvox.</p><a name="What_about_password_protection.3F" id="What_about_password_protection.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What about password protection?</span></h4>

        <p><a href="Password.html" title="Password">Password protection</a> is something that must be implemented at the web server level. MobileMe already had this built-in through its iDisk services. Sandvox tries to work with any hosting provider and cannot assume a particular password protection scheme like iWeb could with MobileMe. (Note that password protection of web pages is one service that will be lost to iWeb users when MobileMe goes away.)</p>

        <p>We recommend contacting your hosting provider: depending on your level of comfort it is sometimes possible to set up password protection of your site, or part of your site, through a web interface provided by your hosting provider.</p><a name="MobileMe" id="MobileMe"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">MobileMe</span></h2><a name="Can_I.2C_or_should_I.2C_host_my_Sandvox_site_on_MobileMe.3F" id="Can_I.2C_or_should_I.2C_host_my_Sandvox_site_on_MobileMe.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Can I, or should I, host my Sandvox site on MobileMe?</span></h4>

        <p>You could, right up until MobileMe goes away on June 30, 2012, but we don’t recommend it. Apple has announced the end of MobileMe. We recommend strongly that you find a new hosting service for your site well in advance of June 30, 2012.</p><a name="Can_I_host_my_iWeb_site_on_some_other_host_besides_MobileMe.3F" id="Can_I_host_my_iWeb_site_on_some_other_host_besides_MobileMe.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Can I host my iWeb site on some other host besides MobileMe?</span></h4>

        <p>Yes, iWeb supports FTP and SFTP and should be able to publish to most other services, just as Sandvox can do. Keep in mind, however, that several important features in iWeb are quite closely dependent on MobileMe. In Apple’s own transition guide, it states: "When publishing an iWeb site to a web hosting service other than MobileMe, the following features are not available: blog and photo comments, website password, blog search, and hit counter.” The long-term fate of iWeb is also unknown.</p><a name="Should_I_do_this_sooner_or_later.3F_Why.3F_What_happens_if_I_put_this_off_until_the_last_minute.3F" id="Should_I_do_this_sooner_or_later.3F_Why.3F_What_happens_if_I_put_this_off_until_the_last_minute.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Should I do this sooner or later? Why? What happens if I put this off until the last minute?</span></h4>

        <p>If you do not give adequate time for your site visitors, and search engines, to find you at your new location, you will likely see a large dropoff in visits. By making the transition as soon as possible, you will give everyone plenty of time to find you at your new location.</p><a name="I.E2.80.99m_using_a_Personal_Domain_with_MobileMe.2C_how_do_I_change_it.3F" id="I.E2.80.99m_using_a_Personal_Domain_with_MobileMe.2C_how_do_I_change_it.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">I’m using a Personal Domain with MobileMe, how do I change it?</span></h4>

        <p>You will need to work with whomever you choose as your new hosting provider, as well as your DNS provider (usually the domain registrar) to turn off your MobileMe Personal Domain and repoint <code>www.yourdomain</code> from MobileMe to your new hosting provider.</p><a name="Page_Layout" id="Page_Layout"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Page Layout</span></h2><a name="Why_can.E2.80.99t_I_drag_objects_to_any_arbitrary_position_on_the_page.3F" id="Why_can.E2.80.99t_I_drag_objects_to_any_arbitrary_position_on_the_page.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Why can’t I drag objects to any arbitrary position on the page?</span></h4>

        <p>iWeb allowed this, but at the expense of clean HTML when published. HTML just isn't designed to allow arbitrary placement of objects, while still wrapping text around them. (iWeb converts many placed objects to non-searchable graphics, rather than indexable HTML.) We believe Sandvox provides a good compromise of options, while producing clean HTML.</p><a name="How_can_I_change_the_background_color.2Fimage_of_the_site.3F" id="How_can_I_change_the_background_color.2Fimage_of_the_site.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How can I change the background color/image of the site?</span></h4>

        <p>Complete background images are not yet supported in Sandvox. Originally Sandvox sites were quite tied to the <a href="Design.html" title="Design">design</a> chosen for them. Many designs now provide multiple color variations. We do understand that people want even more flexibility and are looking at that.</p><a name="How_do_I_change_fill.2C_stroke.2C_shadow.2C_reflection.2C_and_opacity_on_graphic_objects.3F" id="How_do_I_change_fill.2C_stroke.2C_shadow.2C_reflection.2C_and_opacity_on_graphic_objects.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I change fill, stroke, shadow, reflection, and opacity on graphic objects?</span></h4>

        <p>Like many such customizations, this is hard to get right with all <a href="Design.html" title="Design">designs</a>. Though iWeb supports this, it never had a good way to consistently apply such changes to multiple objects across the site. We're working on solving this problem too, to get it right.</p><a name="How_do_I_change_content_size.2C_header_height.2C_footer_height.2C_etc..3F" id="How_do_I_change_content_size.2C_header_height.2C_footer_height.2C_etc..3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I change content size, header height, footer height, etc.?</span></h4>

        <p>Presently, these sorts of items are controlled by the chosen design. We're working towards opening this up but it requires coordination across many dozens of designs. Stay tuned.</p><a name="Text_Editing" id="Text_Editing"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Text Editing</span></h2><a name="How_do_I_format_text.3F" id="How_do_I_format_text.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I format text?</span></h4>

        <p>Unlike iWeb, most text editing commands are found as menu items in the Format menu of the main menu bar. Note that pressing the <i>Return</i> key creates a paragraph break, while <i>Shift-Return</i> enters a line break. HTML makes a far bigger distinction between these two than a typical word processor: Sandvox tries to maintain best practices here.</p><a name="How_do_I_set_Text_and_Link_attributes.3F" id="How_do_I_set_Text_and_Link_attributes.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I set Text and Link attributes?</span></h4>

        <p>Much of these are set by the chosen design and were picked by the designer to work well in most any situation. Presently, the only way to edit many of these attributes is to edit the design itself, or to use Site <a href="Code_Injection.html" title="Code Injection">Code Injection</a> to inject custom CSS overrides into the stylesheet. See <a href="Quickly_modifying_existing_designs.html" title="Quickly modifying existing designs">Quickly modifying existing designs</a>. We intended to bring more text styling options to the <a href="Inspector.html" title="Inspector">Inspector</a>, much like iWeb has, in future versions.</p><a name="Downloads" id="Downloads"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I make a document available for download?</span></h4>

        <p>From the toolbar, select "New → Choose…" and pick the document you’d like to make available for download in the Open panel that appears. Click the Insert button, and a new page representing that document will be inserted into the <a href="Site_Navigator.html" title="Site Navigator">Site Navigator</a>.</p>

        <p>With the downloadable document added to your site, you then typically provide a <a href="Link_Inspector.html" title="Link">link</a> to it somewhere on your site. You can do this by selecting the text you would like to link — e.g. "Download Annual Report" — and then use the <a href="Link_Inspector.html" title="Link Inspector">Link Inspector</a> to set the link to "Page in this Site", and dragging the target from the Inspector to the downloadable item in the <a href="Site_Navigator.html" title="Site Navigator">Site Navigator</a> to link those two up.</p><a name="Photos_and_Photo_Albums" id="Photos_and_Photo_Albums"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Photos and Photo Albums</span></h2><a name="How_does_setting_up_a_photo_album_differ_in_Sandvox.3F" id="How_does_setting_up_a_photo_album_differ_in_Sandvox.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How does setting up a photo album differ in Sandvox?</span></h4>

        <p>Here the terminology between iWeb and Sandvox differs somewhat. In iWeb, a Photo Page contains a grid of thumbnails of photos (up to 99) that have been added to that page; whereas in Sandvox a Photo page is simply that, a page containing a single photo. In Sandvox, a <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collection</a> of photo pages is typically called a Photo Album. A Photo Album comes prepopulated with a <a href="Photo_Grid.html" title="Photo Grid">Photo Grid</a> index that provides the thumbnail grid (and Gallery support) for that collection.</p>

        <p>In iWeb, multiple “Photo Page” galleries are typically kept within the same My Albums page. Sandvox places no such restrictions. A Photo Album can contain other Photo Albums and each grid will be represented by a single thumbnail within the grid of the index above it. This, again, is the concept that collections can contain other collections and that the index of the collection, at each level, “summarizes” or indexes the pages within that collection.</p>

        <p>Taking this to its logical conclusion, a Photo Album doesn't even need to contain photo pages only. It could also represent other pages that happen to have a thumbnail associated with them, that can stand-in for the indexable photo. You can set a thumbnail for any page using the Appearance tab of the <a href="Page_Inspector.html" title="Page Inspector">Page Inspector</a>. Seen in this light, you could organize arbitrary pages — with thumbnails — into a hierarchy of grids that a site visitor might use drill down for more information.</p><a name="Why_aren.27t_there_navigation_buttons_near_the_bottom.3F" id="Why_aren.27t_there_navigation_buttons_near_the_bottom.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Why aren't there navigation buttons near the bottom?</span></h4>

        <p>This has not been a feature of our <a href="Design.html" title="Design">designs</a> up until now. Navigation is generally kept near the top of each page. We may revisit this decision when evaluating new designs.</p><a name="How_do_I_set_up_a_photocast.3F" id="How_do_I_set_up_a_photocast.3F"></a>

        <p>This is automatically set up for you when you add a <a href="Working_with_Photo_Albums_in_Sandvox.html" title="Photo Album">Photo Album</a> to your site. This is done at the <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collection</a> level.

        <p>These are forthcoming in a future release of Sandvox. You can always use the photo editing features of an external application, such as iPhoto, to tweak an image before bringing it in to Sandvox.</p><a name="How_do_I_edit_photo_captions.3F" id="How_do_I_edit_photo_captions.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I edit photo captions?</span></h4>

        <p>Captions are currently set from the page title of the underlying photo page for that photo. This is typically set from the photo title or file name of the photo when the photo page is created. To edit a caption in the photo grid, edit the <a href="Page_Title.html" title="Page Title">page title</a> of the individual photo.</p><a name="Blogging" id="Blogging"></a>

        <p><a href="Blogging_with_Sandvox.html" title="Blog">Blogs</a> work very similarly to <a href="Working_with_Photo_Albums_in_Sandvox.html" title="Photo Album">Photo Albums</a>. They are <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collections</a> of pages; each page is an entry in the blog. The collection page itself contains a <a href="Titles_and_Summaries.html" title="Titles and Summaries">Titles &amp; Summaries</a> index that presents the blog contents. To create a new blog, simply select "New → Blog" from the <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a>. The first entry is added for you to begin editing.</p><a name="How_do_I_add_a_blog_entry.3F" id="How_do_I_add_a_blog_entry.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I customize the appearance of a blog?</span></h4>

        <p>With the blog’s <a href="Index_.html" title="Index">index</a> selected, use the <a href="Object_Inspector.html" title="Object Inspector">Object Inspector</a> to adjust the Titles &amp; Summaries options. Additional options for the <a href="Collection.html" title="Collection">collection</a> as a whole are available in the Collection tab of the <a href="Page_Inspector.html" title="Page Inspector">Page Inspector</a>.</p><a name="How_do_I_set_up_an_RSS_feed.3F" id="How_do_I_set_up_an_RSS_feed.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I set up an RSS feed?</span></h4>

        <p>This is automatically set up for you when you add a new <a href="Blogging_with_Sandvox.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> collection. You can adjust parameters using the Collection tab of the <a href="Page_Inspector.html" title="Page Inspector">Page Inspector</a>. An <a href="RSS_Badge.html" title="RSS Badge">RSS Badge</a> on the blog index page is a handy way to let visitors know that your blog has an RSS feed.</p><a name="How_do_I_change_the_date_of_a_particular_blog_entry.3F" id="How_do_I_change_the_date_of_a_particular_blog_entry.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do I change the date of a particular blog entry?</span></h4>

        <p>You can change the time and date stamp on a particular page (blog entry) using the <a href="Page_Inspector.html" title="Page Inspector">Page Inspector</a> (Date &amp; Time at the bottom). If you have the blog collection (index) page selected, you can use the Collection tab to change sorting to be by either date created or modified.</p><a name="What_about_blog_searching.3F" id="What_about_blog_searching.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What about blog searching?</span></h4>

        <p>Because this requires a server component, Sandvox does not currently ship with this out-of-the-box. We are looking into supporting this in a future release. (Note that iWeb requires publishing to MobileMe for this feature. It will cease to work in iWeb for MobileMe hosted sites when MobileMe goes away.)</p><a name="How_do_comments_work.3F" id="How_do_comments_work.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do comments work?</span></h4>

        <p><a href="Comments.html" title="Comments">Comments</a> are provided by and integrated into Sandvox by third parties. Sandvox currently supports comment systems from Disqus, Intense Debate, and Facebook. "File → Choose Comments Provider…" for more information.</p><a name="Objects_and_Widgets" id="Objects_and_Widgets"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Objects and Widgets</span></h2><a name="What_is_an_iWeb_Widget_in_Sandvox_terminology.3F" id="What_is_an_iWeb_Widget_in_Sandvox_terminology.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">What is an iWeb Widget in Sandvox terminology?</span></h4>

        <p>Sandvox calls these <a href="Object.html" title="Object">Objects</a>. They come from Sandvox plug-ins supplied either by Karelia or by third parties.</p><a name="Where_is_the_Email_Me_button.3F" id="Where_is_the_Email_Me_button.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Where is the Email Me button?</span></h4>

        <p>Sandvox provides two options for this. One is to set an Email <a href="Link_Inspector.html" title="Link">link</a> on whatever text or graphic you choose. The other is to use a <a href="Contact_Form.html" title="Contact Form">Contact Form</a> object. We recommend the latter as your email address is kept hidden and special measures are taken to deter spammers.</p><a name="Is_there_a_Hit_Counter.3F" id="Is_there_a_Hit_Counter.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Is there a Hit Counter?</span></h4>

        <p>Yes. We call it a <a href="Page_Counter.html" title="Page Counter">Page Counter</a> and it is available from the Objects <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a> item.</p><a name="Is_there_a_Google_AdSense_widget.3F" id="Is_there_a_Google_AdSense_widget.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Is there a Google AdSense widget?</span></h4>

        <p>Not at present. It is being worked on, and will be announced when ready, either from Karelia or a third party. In the meantime, it should be possible to use a <a href="Raw_HTML.html" title="Raw HTML">Raw HTML</a> object to include the Google AdSense code on your site.</p><a name="Can_I_add_a_Google_Map_to_my_site.3F" id="Can_I_add_a_Google_Map_to_my_site.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Can I add a Google Map to my site?</span></h4>

        <p>Our Map object is currently in beta. You can download it using the Sandvox &gt; Discover Plug-ins… window. Do keep in mind that it is a beta and doesn’t yet work well with all designs.</p><a name="How_do_you_add_an_HTML_widget.3F" id="How_do_you_add_an_HTML_widget.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">How do you add an HTML widget?</span></h4>

        <p>Sandvox includes a <a href="Raw_HTML.html" title="Raw HTML">Raw HTML</a> object (as well as a Raw HTML page) that is insertable from the Objects <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a> item. Upon insertion, an editing window opens, allowing you to paste or type in your custom code. Click "Update Preview" to see the code take life in the <a href="Web_View.html" title="Web View">Web Editor</a>. If you suspect a problem, you can also validate the HTML right within the raw editor.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that many objects, including raw HTML snippets, often load resources over the Internet for the bulk of their functionality. If nothing is happening in the Web Editor, you many need to turn on ‘Load data from the Internet’ in Sandvox’s <a href="Preferences.html" title="Preferences">Preferences</a> to get things going.</p><a name="Publishing" id="Publishing"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Publishing</span></h2><a name="If_I_continue_to_use_iWeb_but_with_FTP_instead_of_MobileMe.2C_what_do_I_give_up.3F" id="If_I_continue_to_use_iWeb_but_with_FTP_instead_of_MobileMe.2C_what_do_I_give_up.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">If I continue to use iWeb but with FTP instead of MobileMe, what do I give up?</span></h4>

        <p>According to Apple’s own transition guide: "When publishing an iWeb site to a web hosting service other than MobileMe, the following features are not available: blog and photo comments, website password, blog search, and hit counter."</p>

        <p>What these all have in common is they require some server-side functionality beyond what basic FTP hosting provides. With Sandvox we can't be sure what everybody's host supports, making it much harder to implement such functionality. For some things, like <a href="Comments.html" title="Comments">comments</a> and <a href="Page_Counter.html" title="Page Counter">hit counters</a>, we are able to work around that limitation by using a service hosted by Karelia, or another company, such as a third party comments provider.</p><a name="Does_Sandvox_support_FTP.3F" id="Does_Sandvox_support_FTP.3F"></a>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline">Does Sandvox support FTP?</span></h4>

        <p>Absolutely! Sandvox also supports <a href="Uploading_using_SFTP.html" title="SFTP">SFTP</a> which we recommend for secure uploading, if your hosting provider supports it. (Most do.)</p>
