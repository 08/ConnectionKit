        <p>Video pages and objects use Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">Quicktime</a> software to embed the multimedia within the page. Because of this, visitors must have Quicktime installed on their computer to play the Video.</p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Video File Sizes</span></h2>

        <p>When choosing a video file to provide to your website visitors, you should keep in mind that the file should be an appropriate size for viewing over the web, over a reasonable connection speed. The original video files that you have may not be suitable for putting on your website. Since Sandvox doesn't perform any processing on the video you provide, you will need to export an appropriate movie file from QuickTime, iMovie, etc. There are several online resources available (<a href="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/video/webvideo/exporting/" class="external text" title="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/video/webvideo/exporting/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031203185243624" class="external text" title="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031203185243624">here</a>, and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2008/tn2218.html" class="external text" title="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2008/tn2218.html">here</a>, for example) that may be of use.</p><a name="Video_Dimensions" id="Video_Dimensions"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Video Dimensions</span></h2>

        <p>When you add a Video to a site, Sandvox checks the video's width (measured in pixels). If the video is wider than the limits listed below, Sandvox will automatically scale it down and the video will be displayed at this smaller size.</p>

        <p>The maximum widths for movies are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>200 pixels for objects</li>

            <li>320 pixels for pages with the <a href="Sidebar.html" title="Sidebar">Sidebar</a> visible</li>

            <li>640 pixels for pages without the <a href="Sidebar.html" title="Sidebar">Sidebar</a> visible</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Scaling the film down can result in poor quality while viewing online and longer download times. So it's best to scale videos down before incorporating them into your site.</p>

        <p>One good tool for resizing is Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro">Quicktime Pro</a>. Resizing before adding the video to your site will speed load times.</p>

        <p>Note that Sandvox <b>only</b> scales the video file down for viewing. The published file is exactly the same as the original, so if a visitor downloads the movie using Quicktime Pro, they can watch it at full resolution.</p><a name="File_Types" id="File_Types"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">File Types</span></h2>

        <p>The best file format to use is a .mp4 file, saved with the h.264 codec and the baseline profile. (More <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html" class="external text" title="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html">here</a>) If iPhone and iPad compatibility is desired, make sure that the video has been exported for iPhone and/or iPad compatibility from the video creation program. Also, make sure to test using the iPhone or iPad, so that you know the video is playable. (Apple does not provide a mechanism to verify this from the Mac.)</p>

        <p>Remember, just because you can see/hear a video/audio on your mac, doesn't mean it will be usable on somebody else's computer or device, such as a Windows PC. It is important to choose the right format for the file. If a good, universally viewable/audio format is chosen, then Sandvox should be able to present it in such as way that almost all browsers can handle.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>.flv (Flash video) is a usable format, and will work on a number of computers, but will not play on iPad or iPhone.</li>

            <li>.mov (QuickTime) files are good for Macs, and may be viewable on an iPhone/iPad depending on how it was exported, but it will not be viewable on PCs unless they have the QuickTime plugin installed.</li>

            <li>.wmv, .avi formats that are native to Microsoft may be playable on a Mac, but only if a toolkit like Perian has been installed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Sandvox does not support some formats such as Ogg Vorbis audio, Ogg Theora video, or Webm video. These are supported natively by some browser like Firefox and Chrome; however they are not supported directly by Mac OS, and can't be used in Safari.</p>

        <p><b>The inspector will show a warning when partially-supported file formats have been chosen.</b></p><a name="Referencing" id="Referencing"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Referencing</span></h2>

        <p>Video, audio, and flash have a "Copy file into document" checkbox in the inspector. This is initially checked, but if you un-check before the file is saved, you can indicate that the file should *not* be copied into the Sandvox document package, and just be referenced at its original location on disk. If the checkbox remains checked, then once the file is saved, the file is copied into the document, and the checkbox is disabled since you cannot "un-copy" the file from the document any more.</p>

        <p>This option exists because these media files can often be quite large, and it may be wasteful of hard disk space to have them stored in two places on one's computer. However, referencing them rather than copying them into the document means that the document is less portable. (See <a href="Collaborative_Site_Editing.html" title="Collaborative Site Editing">Collaborative Site Editing</a> for more information).</p>

        <p>Images are *always* copied into the document.</p><a name="Settings" id="Settings"></a>
