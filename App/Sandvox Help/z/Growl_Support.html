        <p><a href="http://growl.info/" class="external text" title="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> is a third party application that you may choose to install on your computer. It provides a means for an application to alert you to some change in its state.</p>

        <p>For example, an instant messaging application might use Growl to alert you whenever someone logs on or off. Sandvox features Growl support so that it can alert you after certain events, such as when a site has finished <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a>:</p>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="floatnone">
                <img alt="" src="img/8/83/Sandvox_Growl_Notification_example.png" width="285" height="87" border="0" />
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>By utilizing Growl, you can leave Sandvox to <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publish</a> your site in the background while you work on other things. Once <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> is complete you are conveniently notified.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To install Growl and register for Sandvox notifications:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Go to the <a href="http://growl.info/" class="external text" title="http://growl.info/">Growl page</a>.</li>

                <li>Download Growl</li>

                <li>Once the download is complete, follow the instructions provided with Growl to install it.</li>

                <li>Quit and then relaunch Sandvox. Growl should recognize Sandvox and notify you.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>Sandvox offers two Growl notifications. Open up the System Preferences and go to the Growl pane. You should see in the "Applications" tab Sandvox registered like this:</p>

                <img alt="" src="img/2/2f/Sandvox_Growl_Notifications.png" width="480" height="405" border="0" />
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>You can use the Growl settings here to customize how Sandvox interacts with Growl.</p>

        <p>The current notifications supported are pretty self-explanatory:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Export Complete</dt>

            <dd>Alerts you that Sandvox has finished <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html#Export" title="Publishing Your Site">exporting</a> your site.</dd>

            <dt>Publishing Complete</dt>

            <dd>Alerts you that Sandvox has finished <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publishing Your Site">publishing</a> your site.</dd>
        </dl>
