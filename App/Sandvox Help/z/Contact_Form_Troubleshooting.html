        <p>When first testing a <a href="Contact_Form.html" title="Contact Form">contact form</a>, or after the site is already published, you may find that some messages being sent via the contact form are not reaching you.</p><a name="Setup_Issues" id="Setup_Issues"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Setup Issues</span></h3>

        <p>It may be that when setting up your contact form, you have entered the "<a href="Contact_Form.html#E-mail_Address" title="Contact Form">send to</a>" e-mail address incorrectly. Messages meant for you would be sent to an incorrect address, which would prevent you from receiving them.</p>

        <p>If the email address is not a functioning address, then your website visitor will (usually) get a notification that their email message bounced â€”&nbsp;but you won't. If your visitor has no other way of contacting you, then you will not be able to hear from them.</p>

        <p>If the email address is a legitimate address, but not an address that you check, then neither you nor the sender of the message will realize that there was a problem. If you change your email address, it is critical that you specify your new address.</p>

        <p>Correct the email address using the <a href="Inspector.html" title="Inspector">Inspector</a> and re-publish your site.</p><a name="Server_Issues" id="Server_Issues"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Server Issues</span></h3>

        <p>When your site visitor tries to contact you using the form, their message is transmitted to one of Karelia's servers, and then sent to you via email. If there is an error reaching our relay server, then submitting the form from your website will not succeed. In this case, the site visitor would not see a web page indicating that the message was sent.</p>

        <p>There may also be a problem with the message that is to be sent; for instance, a missing 'from' address. If this is the case, your site visitor should see some kind of error message indicating that their message could not be sent.</p>

        <p>If your site visitor gets to the page that indicates that the message was sent, then our server was able to send the message via email to the address you had specified. At this point, Karelia has no control over what happens to the message; Email can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few days (at absolute worst case) to be delivered.</p><a name="Receiving_Issues" id="Receiving_Issues"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Receiving Issues</span></h3>

        <p>If the message was successfully sent, then the message should be delivered if it was properly addressed and your email system is able to retrieve the message. Some possible reasons that a message may not be delivered:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>The incoming e-mail is being marked as spam.</dt>

            <dd>This is the cause of <i>almost all</i> missing messages. The message may be intercepted by your Internet Provider or mail server (such as MobileMe or Gmail); it may be your mail client program (like Apple Mail or Entourage) that hides the message; or it may be an add-on spam filter (such as <a href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve/" class="external text" title="http://c-command.com/spamsieve/">SpamSieve</a>). Check your junk mail box(es) for miscategorized messages, and adjust your spam filters.</dd>

            <dt>Your mailbox is full</dt>

            <dd>If you have been away on vacation or otherwise unable to check email, your mailbox may get so full that it is unable to accept new messages. (Usually the sender will be notified of this, but you won't be.)</dd>

            <dt>Your mail host is unreachable from our server.</dt>

            <dd>This is rare but it has happened from time to time. You may have success by using some <a href="Hidden_Preferences.html#Contact_Form" title="Hidden Preferences">hidden preferences</a> to change to our alternate mail relay server.</dd>
        </dl><a name="No_Archiving" id="No_Archiving"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">No Archiving</span></h2>

        <p>For privacy reasons, Karelia does not archive any of the messages that are sent via the contact form. If messages were sent to you via the contact form and you did not receive them, we are unable to retrieve those messages for you.</p>
