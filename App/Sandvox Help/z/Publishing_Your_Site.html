        <p>At some point you will want to publish your site. Publishing is simply the process of taking your site from Sandvox and placing it somewhere that is accessible to visitors. Before a site can be published, you must first <a href="Setting_Up_Your_Host.html" title="Setting Up Your Host">set up</a> the <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> Sandvox will be publishing it to.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <p>Note: Sandvox makes use of an open-source FTP/SFTP/WebDAV library that works well with most <a href="Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a>. However, not all <a href="Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a> are alike, so it is possible that you may have trouble publishing. (This is why we allow publication of a <a href="Page.html" title="Page">page</a> in the Demo version of Sandvox so you can verify for yourself that Sandvox can upload to your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a>.) If you do have trouble, please <a href="Support_and_Feedback.html" title="Support and Feedback">contact us</a> to let us know about the problem, and then use an <a href="FTP_client.html" title="FTP client">FTP</a> program to upload your site.</p>
        </div><a name="Publishing_Changes" id="Publishing_Changes"></a>

        <h2>Publishing Changes</h2>

        <p>Generally when publishing, you only want to upload those files that have changed since the site was last published. Publishing the other files will only waste time. This is the default way in which Sandvox publishes a site.</p>

        <p>You can see which <a href="Page.html" title="Page">pages</a> will be published from their marking in the <a href="Site_Outline.html" title="Site Outline">Site Outline</a>; Sandvox places a small blue dot like this <img src="img/d/d1/Stale_page_dimple.png" alt="Stale page dimple" width="3" height="3" /> at the bottom left corner of the icon.</p>

        <div class="center">

            <p><b>Ways to publish the changes to a site:</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Click the "Publish" item in the <a href="Toolbar.html" title="Toolbar">toolbar</a>.</li>

                <li>Choose "Publish Changes" from the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If there are no <a href="Page.html" title="Page">pages</a> that need publishing, Sandvox will inform you and nothing will be uploaded.</p>
        </div><a name="Publishing_Everything" id="Publishing_Everything"></a>

        <h2>Publishing Everything</h2>

        <p>Occasionally you may wish to publish every <a href="Page.html" title="Page">page</a> of a site, regardless of whether Sandvox thinks they need uploading or not.</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <p><b>To publish all pages:</b></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the <a href="Sandvox_Menu_Guide.html#Site" title="Sandvox Menu Guide">Site menu</a>.</li>

                <li>Choose "Publish Entire Site."</li>
            </ol>
        </div><a name="Exporting_a_Site" id="Exporting_a_Site"></a>

        <h2>Exporting a Site</h2>

        <p>Sandvox can also <a href="Exporting_a_Site.html" title="Export">export</a> a site to a folder on your computer.</p><a name="Publishing_Progress" id="Publishing_Progress"></a>

        <h2>Publishing Progress</h2>

        <p>While publishing, Sandvox displays the progress made:</p>

        <div class="bordimg">
            <div class="center">
                <div class="floatnone">
                    <span><img src="img/e/e9/Publishing_progress.jp2" alt="" width="316" height="107" /></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>At any stage you can click the "Stop" button to end publishing. Note that this can leave you with an only half-functional site online.</p>

        <p>Click the "Show Files" triangle to see more detailed information about the which files Sandvox is uploading and how far they have progressed. (Hover your mouse over the icon next to each file or folder in the list to see details about the upload.)</p>

        <p>Once, publishing is complete, Sandvox will inform you and offer to let you view the site online.</p><a name="After_Publishing" id="After_Publishing"></a>

        <h2>After Publishing</h2>

        <p>Once you have published your site, you will probably want to add it to the various search engines (e.g. Google). Please see "<a href="Sandvox_sites_and_search_engines.html" title="Sandvox sites and search engines">Sandvox sites and search engines</a>" for more information.</p>
