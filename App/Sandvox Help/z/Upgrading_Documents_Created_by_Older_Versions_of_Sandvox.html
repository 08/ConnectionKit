        <p>When upgrading an older document for use with Sandvox 2, Sandvox will automatically convert it to a Sandvox 2 document. You are asked first for the name of the site to save; it will be given .sandvox extension<br /></p>

        <p><img alt="Sandvox2upgrade" src="img/9/9a/Sandvox2upgrade.jp2" width="454" height="238" border="0" /></p>

        <p>Your older Sandvox document will remain in place with the current, .svxSite file. You'll still be able to open it with the previous version of Sandvox if needed.</p><a name="Migration" id="Migration"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Migration</span></h2>

        <p>So how do we move to Sandvox 2?</p>

        <p>When you first import a document into Sandvox 2, any custom HTML is left untouched. The site should continue to look as it always has.</p>

        <p>After that, the first edit of some text will kick in the new behaviour. This could be from:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Typing or deleting within the main text of a page</li>

            <li>Selecting the "Edit Raw HTML" menu command</li>

            <li>Moving an image within the text</li>

            <li>Adding or deleting an object in the text</li>

            <li>Typing or deleting in a Text Box</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So what happens when you take one of these actions?</p>

        <p>Sandvox goes through the HTML making up the text. Each piece either gets cleaned up into neat paragraphs, or if Sandvox suspects the code might be custom, converts it to a Raw HTML object. From there you should be able to continue typing normally into the page, and/or edit the HTML objects.</p>

        <p>This logic by its nature has to be guesswork, so if you feel Sandvox is guessing wrong on a particular case, please get in touch with us using the Feedback Reporter, and we'll try our best to improve matters for you.</p>
