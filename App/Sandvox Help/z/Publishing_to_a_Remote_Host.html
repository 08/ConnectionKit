        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Previous Step</span></h2>

        <p>This article is part of the "<a href="Setting_Up_Your_Host.html" title="Setting Up Your Host">Setting Up Your Host</a>" procedure, and is for you if you are <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> your site to a remote host other than MobileMe. If you wish to publish to a MobileMe account, please see the "<a href="Publishing_to_MobileMe.html" title="Publishing to MobileMe">Publishing to MobileMe</a>" article.</p>

        <p>The previous step of this process is "<b><a href="Choosing_a_Publishing_Location.html" title="Choosing a Publishing Location">Choosing a Publishing Location</a></b>."</p><a name="Host_Settings" id="Host_Settings"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Host Settings</span></h2>

        <p>Sandvox will ask you to enter you <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> settings like this:</p>

        <div class="bordimg">
            <div class="center">
                <div class="floatnone">
                    <span><img alt="" src="img/2/26/HSA-host_settings.jp2" width="480" height="356" /></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><br />
        The settings you enter are used by Sandvox to piece together the information required for uploading and viewing the site, as demonstrated by this diagram:</p>

        <div class="bordimg">
            <div class="center">
                <div class="floatnone">
                    <span><img alt="" src="img/f/f3/HSA-URL_components.jp2" width="480" height="214" /></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><br />
        Remember that <b>all</b> of the settings you need to set up your site for <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> should be provided by your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a>. You may need to contact them if you are missing anything.</p><a name="URL_Format" id="URL_Format"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">URL Format</span></h3>

        <p>The address that visitors will view your site at. Generally, something like this:</p>
        <pre>
http://www.example.com
</pre>

        <p>If you are setting up a brand new website, your domain name may not yet point to your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> (or you may not even have bought one yet!). If so, you can still enter the domain here and when Sandvox fails the connection test, just ignore it for the time being. We recommend that once the domain is properly connected you run the <a href="Host_Setup_Assistant.html" title="Host Setup Assistant">Host Setup Assistant</a> again to ensure everything is correct.</p>

        <p>Some <a href="Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a> also provide a link to your account as a subdomain of their website and you could perhaps enter that URL here instead.</p><a name="Hostname" id="Hostname"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Hostname</span></h3>

        <p>The address of the server to connect to when <a href="Publishing_Your_Site.html" title="Publish">publishing</a> your site. Your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> may instead refer to this as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Host name"</li>

            <li>"Server"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The hostname might be basically the same as the URL Format like so:</p>
        <pre>
example.com
</pre>

        <p>or to your hosting provider:</p>
        <pre>
examplehost.com/john
</pre><a name="Upload_Method_and_Port" id="Upload_Method_and_Port"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Upload Method and Port</span></h3>

        <p>The method by which the site will be uploaded to your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a>. The available methods are FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV (but not over SSL). In general, we prefer it if you use "SFTP" since it is more secure, however your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> may not support that. They should tell you which methods they support.</p>

        <p>Sandvox automatically fills in the "Port" field for you. You should <b>only</b> change this value if your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> specifically requires you to.</p><a name="Username" id="Username"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Username</span></h3>

        <p>Your username for logging into the <a href="Host.html" title="Host">Host</a> server. Your <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a> may instead refer to this as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Account ID"</li>

            <li>"User ID"</li>
        </ul><a name="Password" id="Password"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Password</span></h3>

        <p>Your <a href="Password.html" title="Password">password</a> for logging into the <a href="Host.html" title="Host">Host</a> server.</p>

        <p>If you have chosen <a href="Uploading_using_SFTP.html" title="SFTP">SFTP</a> as your upload method, then you can check the "Use public key" box to use a public key instead of a <a href="Password.html" title="Password">password</a>. Please see the "<a href="Uploading_using_SFTP.html" title="Uploading using SFTP">Uploading using SFTP</a>" article for information on this.</p>

        <p>Note that in order to store your <a href="Password.html" title="Password">password</a> securely, Sandvox will save it in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keychain" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keychain">Keychain</a>.</p><a name="Document_Root" id="Document_Root"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Document Root</span></h3>

        <p>If you know your <a href="Document_Root.html" title="Document Root">document root</a>, type it here. (This information should have been supplied by your host when you initially set up service.)</p>

        <p>If you don't know the name of your document root directory, click the "Browseâ€¦" button.</p>

        <p>It will take a moment for the next window to open. If all of the information you've entered is correct, the window that opens will show you the folders available to you on your external host. There should only be a few directories to choose from, and one of these is the folder in which your web site will be stored.</p>

        <p>The document root is <b>often,</b> but <b>by no means always</b> a directory called "www". Your host may use a different name (such as htdocs, httpdocs, html, public_html, or web).</p><a name="Subfolder" id="Subfolder"></a>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline">Subfolder</span></h3>

        <p>If you plan to have multiple sites within the same <a href="Host.html" title="Host">host</a>, then they must be in separate subfolders. Enter a name for the subfolder this site will be placed in or leave it blank. You do <b>not</b> need to alter the <a href="Publishing_to_a_Remote_Host.html" title="URL Format">URL Format</a> to include your choice of subfolder. You cannot use any incompatible characters, such as spaces.</p><a name="Next_Step" id="Next_Step"></a>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline">Next Step</span></h2>

        <p>Once this information has been entered, click the "Continue" button to move on to "<b><a href="Testing_Your_Connection.html" title="Testing Your Connection">Testing Your Connection</a></b>."</p>
