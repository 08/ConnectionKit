//  An SVEditingOverlay view is used to place over a WebView so that it can gain early access to hit testing in order to deny certain events reaching the WebView. By doing so it can create a UI paradigm whereby areas of the WebView becme "selectable" â€“ that is, a click will place a selection border around an object rather than performing the normal action. The selected object can then be manipulated (e.g. change size, reposition), or a second click will allow access to WebKit's usual behaviour for the content.

#pragma mark Event Handling

/*  SVWebEditingOverlay overrides NSView's default hit testing behaviour in some important ways:
 *
 *      1.  If the point corresponds to the current selection, the receiver will be returned.
 *
 *      2.  Otherwise, hit testing will be delegated to the receiver's Data Source.
 *
 *      3.  BUT, depending on the current event, a different view may be returned that will handle a particular event type before passing it onto the real recipient. This has to be done in -hitTest: so as to hook into Cocoa's event handling mechanisms. If you're looking to avoid this, use the -editingOverlayHitTest: method which will ignore the requirement.
