example_design	-- This is an example of a Sandvox design, our "Aqua" design. If you copy the
				"Testing_Files" folder into this folder, and then open all of the files inside
				with your browser, you will be able to see how well this design performs under
				a variety of conditions.  (There are some improvements we need to make!)

Testing_Files -- Many files that you will need to use to make sure your CSS is correct.
				For testing, this folder should live inside the folder that contains main.css (and your other
				image/css files).  When you open the files in the Browser, you will see how well your design
				looks under a variety of options.
					THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER SHOULD NEVER BE MODIFIED!
					
The final delivery for a design should have:
