\fs22 \cf2 REGARDING THE COMPONENTS OF THE DESIGN KIT:\cf0 \
1. The Design Kit is composed of several files which together provide the specifications, CSS code, and design advice related to developing designs for Sandvox.\
\
2. CSS files are Copyright \'a9 2005, 2006 by Karelia Software. Use of the CSS files in the Design Kit is subject to the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license. Please see paragraph 4 under "Regarding What You Produce With The Design Kit" for more information about the effect of this license arrangement on designs you produce.\
\
3. Use of images that appear in Karelia designs is subject to the following terms and conditions:\
	(a) All images are Copyright \'a9 2005, 2006 by Karelia Software. All rights reserved.\
	(b) Karelia grants to you a nonexclusive license to incorporate images used in Karelia designs in your own designs only to the extent that your designs have been prepared for use solely in the Sandvox environment. This license to you does not give you the right to use Karelia images in designs for other web site development software applications, and does not give you the right to use Karelia images in other contexts. Use of Karelia images in designs for software applications other than Sandvox or in other contexts requires the prior written approval of a duly authorized representative of Karelia.\
\
\cf2 REGARDING WHAT YOU PRODUCE WITH THE DESIGN KIT:\cf0 \
4. Consistent with the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license, the CSS file(s) that you produce with the Design Kit may be shared or sold by you, but only under the terms of the same Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license that is applicable to the CSS files in the Design Kit.\
\
5. You retain copyright and the rights protected by copyright in your images that you incorporate in your design. We encourage you to make the images you have created and incorporated in your design available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license.\
\
6. Karelia encourages you to submit your design(s) to Karelia for inclusion in the "design spotlight" (or similar feature) on the Karelia web site. By submitting your design(s) to Karelia you grant to Karelia an unrestricted, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up worldwide license to use and to sublicense the use of your design(s), including your images, for the purpose of development and marketing of Sandvox and as part of the design library in future versions of Sandvox or as part of a supplementary design library that may be available via Karelia's web site. Should Karelia choose to spotlight your design on its web site and/or to include your design in a design library you will be credited as the designer but agree that no further compensation will be due.\
\
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6, if you have made your design(s) available commercially prior to submitting your design(s) to Karelia and you inform Karelia of that fact when submitting your design(s) to Karelia, if Karelia chooses to spotlight your design, you grant to Karelia an unrestricted, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up worldwide license to use and to sublicense the use of your design(s), including your images, for the purpose of development and marketing of Sandvox but not as part of the design library in future versions of Sandvox or as part of a supplementary design library that may be available via Karelia's web site. Should Karelia choose to spotlight your design on its web site Karelia agrees that it will include information (e.g., a link to your own web site) so that Sandvox users may contact you directly.\
